# WindTurbine
3D Printed Wind Turbine Project 

- Class project that involved designing and manufacturing a 3D-Printed Wind turbine from scratch

Design Considerations/Restrains
- Total Volume of material < 17 cm^3
- Must be circularly symmetric

Blade Design Considerations
- Must be thin enough to not use as much material
- Must be thick enough due to printer restraints
- Angle of Twist between 10-20 degrees to optimize energy output (This design uses a 14 degree twist angle)
- Angle of attack between 8-15 degrees to optimize lift This design used a 10 degree angle of attack)

How it works
- The blades were attatched to a motor housing on the wind turbine body where it was also attatched to a small motor generator that was connected to a multimeter to measure current, voltage, and resistance.
- The air source came from a heavy duty leaf blower
- A stiffness test was also performed to see how rigid the structure was.
